# Harvard-Art-Musuem-API-Project

This project explores Harvard Art museum API, querying data of 1000 artworks (each has 60 columns) and then storing the full dataframe into 5 tables linked in a 'SQLite' database. Inspired by "the Story of Art Without Men" by Katy Hessel, this project also conducted basic data analysis and drew visualisation from a gender perspective. Research questions include: what is the distribution of gender in all objects, what is the proportional distribution of gender by division, and what is the relationship between gender and popularity.
